# Identity & Privilege Separation

## Objective
Implement principle of least privilege by separating administrative and standard accounts.

## System Naming Convention

Computer renamed to:
WIN11-ADMIN

Why:
- Clear host identification
- Enterprise-style naming
- Useful for log correlation

## Account Structure

Accounts created:
- localadmin (Administrator)
- standarduser (Standard User)

## Security Concept

Principle of Least Privilege:
Users should only have permissions necessary to perform required tasks.

This reduces:
- Attack surface
- Impact of compromise
- Risk of privilege escalation
